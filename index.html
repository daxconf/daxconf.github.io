                <p>
                  The 2nd annual DAX 2022 Conference was held at UMBC on June 10th
                  and focused on data science, analytics, and general data
                  exploration. Engineers, data scientists, analytic developers,
                  system architects, and business leaders shared their
                  experiences and presented topics of interest to the local data
                  community. Attendees included engineers, thought leaders,
                  business leaders, and professionals from local government,
                  government defense and intelligence agencies, start-up
                  companies, large data analytic and data science companies, and

                          The three most important analytic innovations I’ve
                          seen in three decades of extracting useful information
                          from data have to do with: Ensemble models, Target
                          Shuffling, and Cognitive Biases. Ensembles are sets of
                          competing models that often combine to be more
                          accurate than the best of their components. Target
                          Shuffling is a resampling method that corrects for
                          “p-hacking” or the “vast search effect” where spurious
                          correlations are frequently seized upon by modern
                          methods’ ability to try millions of hypotheses. And
                          the third, Cognitive Biases, is the dawning
                          understanding of how deeply flawed our own reasoning
                          naturally is. This especially reveals how doomed our
                          projects will be unless we seek out – and attend to –
                          external critique.

                      <p>
                        John Elder founded the world’s most experienced data
                        science company, Elder Research, 27 years ago. He has
                        led teams to solve tough challenges to, for example:
                        detect fraud, find insider threats, discover a drug,
                        time markets, predict needed maintenance, and analyze
                        vast networks. John has co-authored three books – on
                        data mining, text mining, and ensembles – two of which
                        won “book of the year” in Mathematics or Computer
                        Science. He has invented analytic breakthroughs, chairs
                        international conferences, and is a popular keynote
                        speaker, illuminating complex topics with clarity and
                        humor. Dr. Elder is an (occasional) Adjunct Professor at
                        UVA and was named by President Bush to serve five years
                        on a panel to guide technology for national security.

                          It has been over half a century since man first walked
                          on the moon. In that time, space has become even more
                          important to modern life. All of the 16 critical
                          infrastructure sectors that we consider vital to the
                          economic and public safety of the United States rely
                          in one way or another on space. Hackers and
                          adversarial nations know this and have been ramping up
                          their attacks.

                          To combat threats against space-based resources,
                          BigBear.ai partnered with Redwire to create a digital
                          twin engine called SpaceCREST, Space Cyber Resiliency,
                          through Evaluation and Security Testing.

                          What is a digital twin? Let’s ask ChatGPT. A digital
                          twin is a virtual representation of a physical object
                          or system used for modeling, simulation, and analysis.
                          Digital twins are used to track and predict the
                          performance and behavior of the corresponding
                          real-world entities. Digital twins can also be applied
                          to various applications, such as manufacturing,
                          healthcare, transportation, and cyber security.
                          Digital twins contain data from sensors and other
                          sources to provide an accurate, real-time
                          representation of the physical object, enabling
                          organizations to make informed decisions and optimize
                          operations.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                          At the heart of SpaceCREST is a digital twin that
                          models and simulates complex space-based assets that
                          provide the ability to quickly detect anomalous
                          behavior. We use it as part of the National Security
                          effort to understand, manage, and reduce risk to our
                          cyber and physical infrastructure. We leverage the
                          power of digital twins with artificial intelligence to
                          fight hackers… in space.

                          This talk covers the creation of the BCSTAT program,
                          which was conceived in order to foster a more data
                          driven Baltimore County. This talk highlights all of
                          the great work being done to identify need and provide
                          the appropriate resources. There is a component of
                          open data and public facing dashboards along with the
                          struggle with data sharing at the local level. It
                          concludes with the American Rescue Plan work and how
                          Baltimore County is one of the few jurisdictions to
                          actually create their own methodology for the
                          underserved.

                          common problem that I have run into is having business
                          stakeholders question if my teams work is needed or
                          wanted to opt for a third party tool/vendor that did
                          machine learning/ai as part of the package. In this
                          presentation I want walk through how I have had
                          success overcoming the perceptions of data science
                          team/projects and executing a high preforming data

                          pillars needed for a high functioning team(people,

                          Can you beat Joe Dimaggio’s 56 consecutive game hit
                          streak? The short answer is no, you cannot. But, can
                          you play Bet MGM’s “Beat The Streak” and win $5.6
                          million? Yes, you can! In this presentation FanGraphs
                          writer and Data Scientist Lucas Kelly will present how
                          he used machine learning in an attempt to predict the
                          major league baseball hitter most likely to get a hit
                          in a major league baseball game each day. Lucas will
                          dive into the features that a supervised machine
                          learning model is trained on, the sources of training,
                          testing and deployment datasets and will analyze his
                          progress on the current MLB season. You will see how
                          machine learning pipelines, API calls, and out-of-box
                          thinking come together to make daily predictions and
                          how this system can be scaled to share with other
                          players. Come and see how machine learning and python
                          may just be able to help Beat The Streak players gain
                          an edge.

                      <p>
                        I like to be an agent of change; the force that moves a
                        seemingly immovable object into a more positive
                        direction, or sometimes just dragging it along with me.
                        My career has taken me through many different offices
                        and contracts as I went from linguist, to analyst, to
                        program manager. Now I’m thrilled to lend my efforts to
                        Data Works MD and DAX and help bring together data
                        enthusiasts from Maryland.
